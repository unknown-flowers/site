their fear fell burning,<br>
a sun poured over them.<br>
the brothel&rsquo;s ruins,<br>
the ruins of dogs, of people.<br>
burnt<br>
into time, into shadows<br>
as sights for the future visitors.<br>
<br>
our dreams fell burning,<br>
dichotomies poured over us.<br>
the ruins of love, of trust.<br>
burnt<br>
into hearts, into minds<br>
as sights for the future lovers.<br>
<br>
as you guide me<br>
through your italian ruins.<br>
dead stars fall burning into me.<br>
and their ashen silt swallows us slowly.<br>

<h4 id="_alimentari-powercut_"><em>Alimentari Powercut</em></h4>
<p><br>
The tiny grocery shop, selling the overripe, juicy local fruits and olives.
Rancid cheese and dry bread.
The elderly Signores drunk, every night.
Their sweaty faces smiling and singing calmly into the evening heat accompanied by a little orchestra of fans.
A goldfish pond in the front with a soft mossy fountain.
<br>
<br>
And in an instant the whole world shrinks into this room.
The invisible threads that brought all customers into this shop, to just run in parallel for a short while, supposed to take them away without synchronizing, suddenly intertwined to a knot.
Like yesterday&rsquo;s seafood spaghetti.
The obviousness, the implicitness of the light, suddenly gone.
The world stops and shrinks to the size of a goldfish pond.
All the different worlds the customers brought in their heads, merge into this tiny room, into a single tiny world.
And for a short while, only this one world exists and we all live in it together, in a single hemisphere of darkness.
Connected by the malfunction of the taken-for-granted, by the absence of the artificial day, connected by the instinct of being scared in the dark.
A tiny world, disconnected, surrounded by a darkness like fish in the aquamarine infinity of a nightly ocean.
<br>
<br>
I can feel how fragile our world is, how we all are scared in the dark.
When the lights, fans and freezers die a quiet, collective and unexpected death, when strangers suddenly realize that they belong to the same species.
When the distance between us gets switched off like the lights.
Then we feel how absurd it is to be attached to anything in this transience and uncertainty.
Anything but the longest now.
<br>
<br>
When the lights turn back on, in a common spirit, the newly found congeners, the fellow sufferers suddenly look at each other and smile.
Half relieved, half amused.
The farouche Italian woman with the light dress on tainted skin, suddenly recommends the Burrata cheese.
The sweaty face starts singing much louder than before.
The fans and freezers resurrect and start humming again.
And the invisible knot unties and lets us escape the flickering neon light, as strangers, back into the darkness of the nightly streets, the darkness of our very own little worlds, with ourselves as the sun, at the centre of its universe.
Forgetting the fears, forgetting the touch of mortality, attaching back to the implicitness of light, the implicitness of lightness of being.
Continuing to live with our eyes firmly shut.
While in the pond the goldfish are floating.
Sleeping with their eyes wide open (because they don&rsquo;t have lids).

<h4 id="_sea-legs_"><em>sea-legs</em></h4>
<p><br>
the organic shapes of the little houses built into the steep coastal cliffs,
their geometry seems to be shaking after half a day on the boat.<br>
<br>
riding waves in a restaurant chair.<br>
illusion of motion,<br>
vertigo,<br>
dizziness.<br>
<br>
drinking beer, being drunk from the waves and the sun.
and the world is a pizza salame.<br>
