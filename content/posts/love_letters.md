### Sea Turtles

I am trapped on this island by a typhoon. It went on for an
entire day and it blew my busy travelling schedule towards
the open sea.
The wind is still strong over the lagoon, as I am sitting here
on the stony beach, thinking of a requiem for the harbour’s
clock that was broken by the storm. While I am watching
the white angry waves as they are washing the remainders
of time into the ocean. Which seamlessly fades into the
clouds where I imagine the horizon to be, in a soft, rainy,
grey sfumato.

I am sitting among countless of stones and rocks coloured
in all the possible gradients of grey to grey, like in an Elephant graveyard of grey hearts.
A grey camouflage only
to be disturbed by a single orange dot. An orange actually. Maybe one of those ripe and juicy fruits, the orange
tree was bragging with upon my arrival a few days ago.
Bragging about its subtropical, almost erotic fertility and
plentifulness. Unusual. Bragging seems not to be a thing
here in Japan but rather conformity, like being a pebble
among pebbles (though, often with a prism inside). This
orange, unlike me, a complement of the stones. Neighbours
with nothing in common but the address. After the storm,
the oranges were all gone and the tree was left naked. All
eros stripped off along with its dress, like a tinder date on
the sobering next morning after a (not so) stormy night.
Left almost shy and embarrassed and thus, finally, seamlessly blending in to this society of shame like my heart
blends in with the society of stones.

A subtropical paradise with a dead orange, dead wood,
dead fish, time and plans, dead as well. All killed by the
typhoon, all stranded on the same beach. Random casualties in a shared random grave, and a random funeral guest
not being able to leave like in a Buñuel movie.

How do they hold a funeral service in this culture of rituals
and masks? No free funeral drinks to dissolve the irreversibilities.
Though, when buying a Sapporo at the local Family
Mart, they give you a few bows for free. In general people
bow a lot here, it is a rather service-oriented society, an
engineered society. They reached a higher level of civilization by even engineering a public protocol, a well defined
interface for any kind of human interactions, a mask. It
seems. So probably bowing is what they do at the funerals
as well, maybe they even do this to newborn babies, who
knows. A final bow for the deceased, who might bow too
a final time to full-fill their part of the protocol. I wouldn’t
be surprised. So I buy a few beers and bow a few times, then dissolve the worries, caused by this unexpected
exile from time, to finally send them ashore with a detour
through my bladder. Give them a final bow and send them
on a journey to the same unknown destination my schedule
was taken to by the wind. The same destination time was
abducted to. The same destination the erotic oranges, that
were blown into the ocean, are heading towards, where even
the juiciest fruits and the brightest colours will eventually
have to go. The same place where you might be waiting for
me.

When I was a child, it felt like eternity is right now, not
before I was born or after I will be dead. Every day was
timeless and naive like this beach is right now. Time, if it
existed at all, was a simple thing. Other people’s thing, a
grown-up’s thing that didn’t concern me. An infinite infantile resource.\
Having seen the sea turtles on the sandy beach yesterday, I
understand only now, that like them, I too have to return,
I want to return. Though, not to this island or the beach I
was born but to the infantile absence of time. Return to be
floating timeless and naive through an eternity with broken
clocks. Floating, with you. Slowly.

### Poems (we will never read)

The term of writing poetry is wrong. Its just writing down
a thought. A result of a thought process or gedankenexperiment in a hypothetical parallel reality, phrasing it in a way
that its obviousness is obvious. Writing it down is at most
documenting and archiving it in an external brain, sharing
it’s thoughts with others. Or not. The process leading to
this thought is a reflection of the way someone lives and
thinks. Thus, poetry is not an act of writing but living.

A poem existed before someone thought it, it just waits
to be decoded. Their patterns exist all around us, in the
subway, on the street, in the clouds, on Sentinel Island, in
the grocery store, in you and me, in network protocols, in
silicon chips, in π or e, in patterns and numbers, entropy,
distortion, symmetrie, in animals, in olive trees, black holes and the planets, in a birds view, under a microscope,
in bodies, porn, music, in death and birth, probably everywhere. Hence, poetry is not an act of writing but reading.
Reading the (not) obvious and phrasing and connecting it
in the (not) obvious way, to the context it currently appears in, to the person it appears in. Like this person and
context a poem might be transient and ephemeral and may
disappear at any time along with them. Likely, the very same poem will re-appear in different times and contexts and
might get decoded accordingly anew, with new tools, new
language, new thoughts, as soon as its pattern is obvious
to someone.

Thus, poems are probably modular, abstract patterns of
thinking, decoupled and abstracted from but also tightly
bound to the context they appear in, to the person they
appear in. Being abstract and concrete at the same time,
their abstraction makes them applicable to different contexts and their concreteness connects them to the reader
and thus gives them access to the abstraction and thereby
the ability to switch context mentally and emotionally as
well. If they see it. If they allow it.

Thus, poems are for rhythm, for emphasis, for essence. Not
rhythmic patterns of syntax or language but rhythmic patterns of thinking. Not a way of writing or a literary form
but a way of reading life, reading the pathos of things.

And sometimes, just a drunken thought that leaves no
trace, dying in the very same second it gets born. But even
if still born, invisible or encrypted, it just feels contenting
to know that they are surrounding us. Like it is contenting
to know that you exist.
Somewhere. With many faces in many people. Yet, invisibly to me like an unread poem.

### Holons

When I was 7 a friend of my parents died. I realized that he
will be gone forever. The concept of eternity suddenly became real, the concept of my own eventual death became
real. Within a second. Parents, grand parents, sister, friends, dog. We all will be gone for eternity. Eternity rushed
into my awareness, into my reality, into all the innocence.
It was violently burned into my synapses permanently.
Prior to this, life was like playing with toys in a bathtub.
Now, suddenly, I was floating in an infinite ocean without knowing how to swim.
Alone.

I think all humans have to go through this experience and
we all get traumatized from it. This is when the little monkey brain becomes a little human brain I guess (not everybody makes this step it seems).

You are afraid of eternity like we all are. But I think eternity and time in general don’t exist in the way we think of
it. Time is just a rhythm of eternally recurring patterns.
The state of how the atoms in the universe are organized
is constantly rotating through all possible combinations.
Like what Nietzsche said about eternal recurrence. In the
current series of states the two of us exist, in past states
we didn’t and in future states we probably won’t. But if
time is eternal, it will become a perfect circle again, so we
will become again. And if the current state will never recur,
still there is no need to be scared. Because all our fears will
die with us and all our tears will dry. And we will be part
of what is part of us. Always. I am part of you and you are
part of me.

### Echochamber

The sharp fear of failure and loss, of vulnerability, of exposing my weakest spots and thoughts.
Of losing something essential, losing the part of myself that I just found in you, the part of you that I just found in myself.
It oscillates, sharp and strident like a high pitch crystalline sound, between my mind, my heart, my dick.
As if all the truth I found in you, so fragile like it was made from glass, shatters in an echoic chamber.

The soft fear of the vanishing sensation of newness, of routine, that slowly flutters on us like snowflakes.
A puffy filter that absorbs what we say to each other, clouds the way we look at one another, washes the colour of our conversations, suffocates our playfulness.
As if the once bright commonalities between us slowly surge into an avalanche of normality, filling our ears, eyes and mouths, leaving us buried alive. Buried numb in a concrete darkness, side by
side, with infinity in-between us.

### Trusting trust

Trust originates in me, it is a question of how I want to
live. I want to be true to myself. Cheating on you would
be lying to myself in the first place. I would make both of
us live a lie, same goes for you. If you would abuse your
power over me or I over you, we wouldn’t be contained in
each other any more and our paths would diverge naturally.
Torn apart by the same simple word you once gave me, that
made use walk together. We will drift apart. One would go
with the truth, the other one with the lies. Painful but
pure, as we are.

### Defloration

It is hard to accept the past. There have been love and
lovers before us. For each of us. It is fine that there has
been someone before me. It is okay that there might be
someone after me, if our paths diverged. But there can’t
be someone in between. This would be the one after me
necessarily.

For me, there is a thin delicate membrane that contains us.
That connects us wherever we go. That protects something
like our very own innocence and purity, the things that we
share with each other only. It may not be visible or doesn’t
exist for you at all. Or for others. But for me it is there.
I can feel it. I can even see it somehow. Letting someone
in between us, would deflorate this membrane from the
inside and would let us drop unprotected into the void. We
would drift apart into infinity to where we came from, until
there will be an infinite distance between us again, like an
astronaut drifting through space, away from home.

To me it seems this membrane is made from the same delicate silk that divides life from death. Once it is ripped,
it is not reversible. If it got destroyed, ’us’ will leave and
at most continues to exist in digital epitaphs like this one.
Just until a solar wind wipes it out, or the bits start rotting. Or maybe in blurry coloured memories, fading into
distortion and meaninglessness of a retirement home. But
for sure we will continue to exist in my mind, just until it
stops glowing eventually. No matter what.

kinda high pace. Effort is mostly needed to setup the habits and build the routine. And especially in defending it
against all the people and noise throwing dogmas at me
and marketing their egos, against seduction and shallow
promises. We live in a place full of shallow promises so it
is not easy to create a real substrate to grow substantial
habits from, to learn from. To grow a philosophy. Especially, if you have darkness inside you, those surrogates are
tempting ghost lights.

The second thing is breaking the routine. Choosing a place
or maybe being chosen by a place, go there and float.
Consume the stream of events of reality, without dependencies
and expectations. Floating and discovering while taking
my habits and philosophy along to see if they survive in
the wild, to test them in a tougher reality. By clearing my
mind and filling it with all the newish randomness I am
immersed in. Giving my thoughts and needs the next iteration of evolution, giving birth to the next generation of
challenges for my habits and biases. Exposing my beliefs
to the new environment and let them fight for survival, the
false ones die and the truthful flourish. To take them back
to the routine and fine tune them before they will be tested
again.

So routine for me is not stagnation or boredom but a flawless flow. A flow of many in- and output streams, of many
layers of habits. An operating system so carefully configured that it seems to be standing still while actually being
highly effective, dynamic and flexible, with a high volume
throughput. Error handling routines based on experience,
principles and philosophy, so effective in handling exceptions that the flow does not get distorted (in an ideal future).
It provides the stability and ensures that the essentials are
taken care of and thus, frees resources to handle challenges.
It may look static or frozen like a laminar flow, you know
these streams of water that look as if they were standing
still. An illusion that’s caused by frictionless moving parallel layers (trust is one of them). That’s what routine is
to me, though, to others it may seem boring. I think mostly because they failed to fight for the things they want to
become part of their routines. Not that this is perfectly
working for me yet but this is what I try to build. What I
work for every day.

And this is why I don’t need to bungee jump into an abyss
but go for a walk instead or travel to a tougher reality once
in a while. Because it’s a philosophy and a habit. That’s
why I like coming home to you, that’s why I never get bored
with you. Because you are my routine now, the layer that
was always missing.

<br>
{{< /rawhtml >}}

I never fell in love with a person but I also never felt lonely.
I was in love with the unknown woman in my mind whenever I needed it. I constructed her to fit whatever I needed
at a particular time so she developed along with me and
my dreams or maybe she developed me and my dreams,
I don’t know. I gave her many faces and masks, different
hair colours and looks, names, ethnics, bodies, tempers and
smiles.

This imaginary woman, the composite sketch of my longings, that I was waiting or maybe searching for, I could
never find her in real live. Only in myself, only in my
dreams. I talked to her in my thoughts and sometimes wrote poems and letters to her. I didn’t get anything back and
mostly she just laughed about me, which made me push
harder to become better and more humble (not sure if that
worked though). But just knowing that she is there let me
never feel lonely. And I always knew that she existed somewhere in reality, maybe even close but I will never meet
her for real. So I had to find this love alone, inside of me.

I guess, expecting eternal loneliness is a good filter to learn
what you really want and need from others and yourself.
The lack of something essential makes it easier to recognize its value than the possibility to choose it freely from a
number of easily available options (a bit like shopping in a
soviet supermarket vs an American one). And only while
being alone I could truly feel how fragile our world is. How
fragile we are in this transience, predetermined to be just
passing by. Not staying long enough to understand that we
are all lonely and lost together alone within eternity. Probably. And each of us is born alone, will die alone and in
between will be alone among others. For me the loneliness
among others is the unbearable one not the loneliness of
being alone. Being together but alone is what hurts us so
badly I think, being the only specimen of a species while
the others have plenty of company. Being able to share a
truth with someone is maybe the most powerful tool in
fighting the trauma caused by the awareness of our own
transience within eternity. Im Umkehrschluss, when there
is nobody sharing the perspective on life means to be truly
alone I guess.

Satisfying physical needs together is only a temporary fix.
My body being close to a woman, too warm. My mind being
alone in the void, even next to someone, too cold. But being
alone with my imaginary love felt close when I needed it.
So I chose someone’s warm body and my/her warm mind.
This woman’s ghost in my brain (likely the mind is more
than the brain) created a feeling of being connected to the
actual essence of life and made my existence more real,
although it originated in something very unreal. But the
need for it is real.

Then suddenly, from one day to the next, she - the only
other specimen of my species - and all this was gone. The
shadow of all my thoughts and longings just vanished. Because I found you. Or because you found me. Or because
she just became real, you became real, I don’t know.
With you, like with her, I never feel lonely. Far or close
physically, but very close in my mind always. The image of
you in my thoughts is as lively as you are in reality. It never
fades or gets weak. You are always with me now like the
unknown love was with me before. You connect me to the
(emotional) essence of reality more than anything before.
You are so close that I often think I know you perfectly
well. And in the next moment, you are a totally unknown
woman to me that I can find so many new things within,
that I can learn so many things from that were unknown to
me before. Partly because I didn’t know they exist, partly
because I considered them to be just for other people, the
real humans, not for me. I can find these things in you now
that I never could imagine to find. And yes, you have the
best ass.

Once we are dead we are trapped in the interpretation of
other peoples minds. Until they die as well. I read this somewhere and it sounds reasonable. Though, once we are
dead, we probably don’t care any more. It also brings up
the question what my existence is. My own perception of
the universe and myself within the universe? Other’s perception of me within the universe? Which would scale my
existence a lot. The universe’s perception of itself through
me and of me? Probably all of it, maybe none of it. But it
is very likely that either the universe or someone else has
a more realistic image of myself than I do. Which again,
lets me question the concept of self/ego. It is nice to know that
I exist in many minds and server racks, even after my death. Although I claim not to care about what other people
think of me, I think my ego does. Not so sure how much
I care what computers think of me. All this and my ego
are probably the major drive behind writing all this down,
besides trying to answer your (and my) question who I am.
And that I stopped watching porn and thus made my day 1
hour longer. You asked me to help you understanding me.
I hope this answer a few of your questions. Probably not
but I love you, whoever you are. At least this might answer
one.
