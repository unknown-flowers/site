### Sea Turtles

I am trapped on this island by a typhoon. It went on for an
entire day and it blew my busy travelling schedule towards
the open sea.\
The wind is still strong over the lagoon, as I am sitting here
on the stony beach, thinking of a requiem for the harbour’s
clock that was broken by the storm. While I am watching
the white angry waves as they are washing the remainders
of time into the ocean. Which seamlessly fades into the
clouds where I imagine the horizon to be, in a soft, rainy,
grey sfumato.

I am sitting among countless of stones and rocks coloured
in all the possible gradients of grey to grey, like in an Elephant graveyard of grey hearts.
A grey camouflage only
to be disturbed by a single orange dot. An orange actually. Maybe one of those ripe and juicy fruits, the orange
tree was bragging with upon my arrival a few days ago.
Bragging about its subtropical, almost erotic fertility and
plentifulness. Unusual. Bragging seems not to be a thing
here in Japan but rather conformity, like being a pebble
among pebbles (though, often with a prism inside). This
orange, unlike me, a complement of the stones. Neighbours
with nothing in common but the address. After the storm,
the oranges were all gone and the tree was left naked. All
eros stripped off along with its dress, like a tinder date on
the sobering next morning after a (not so) stormy night.
Left almost shy and embarrassed and thus, finally, seamlessly blending in to this society of shame like my heart
blends in with the society of stones.

A subtropical paradise with a dead orange, dead wood,
dead fish, time and plans, dead as well. All killed by the
typhoon, all stranded on the same beach. Random casualties in a shared random grave, and a random funeral guest
not being able to leave like in a Buñuel movie.

How do they hold a funeral service in this culture of rituals
and masks? No free funeral drinks to dissolve the irreversibilities.
Though, when buying a Sapporo at the local Family
Mart, they give you a few bows for free. In general people
bow a lot here, it is a rather service-oriented society, an
engineered society. They reached a higher level of civilization by even engineering a public protocol, a well defined
interface for any kind of human interactions, a mask. It
seems. So probably bowing is what they do at the funerals
as well, maybe they even do this to newborn babies, who
knows. And final bow for the deceased, who might bow too
a final time to full-fill their part of the protocol. I wouldn’t
be surprised. So I buy a few beers and bow a few times as
well. Then dissolve the worries, caused by this unexpected
exile from time, to finally send them ashore with a detour
through my bladder. Give them a final bow and send them
on a journey to the same unknown destination my schedule
was taken to by the wind. The same destination time was
abducted to. The same destination the erotic oranges, that
13were blown into the ocean, are heading towards, where even
the juiciest fruits and the brightest colours will eventually
have to go. The same place where you might be waiting for
me.

When I was a child, it felt like eternity is right now, not
before I was born or after I will be dead. Every day was
timeless and naive like this beach is right now. Time, if it
existed at all, was a simple thing. Other people’s thing, a
grown-up’s thing that didn’t concern me. An infinite infantile resource.\
Having seen the sea turtles on the sandy beach yesterday, I
understand only now, that like them, I too have to return,
I want to return. Though, not to this island or the beach I
was born but to the infantile absence of time. Return to be
floating timeless and naive through an eternity with broken
clocks. Floating, with you. Slowly.

### Poems (we will never read)

The term of writing poetry is wrong. Its just writing down
a thought. A result of a thought process or gedankenexperi-
ment in a hypothetical parallel reality, phrasing it in a way
that its obviousness is obvious. Writing it down is at most
documenting and archiving it in an external brain, sharing
it’s thoughts with others. Or not. The process leading to
this thought is a reflection of the way someone lives and
thinks. Thus, poetry is not an act of writing but living.
A poem existed before someone thought it, it just waits
to be decoded. Their patterns exist all around us, in the
subway, on the street, in the clouds, on Sentinel Island, in
the grocery store, in you and me, in network protocols, in
silicon chips, in π or e, in patterns and numbers, entropy,
distortion, symmetrie, in animals, in olive trees, black ho-
les and the planets, in a birds view, under a microscope,
in bodies, porn, music, in death and birth, probably every-
where. Hence, poetry is not an act of writing but reading.
Reading the (not) obvious and phrasing and connecting it
in the (not) obvious way, to the context it currently ap-
pears in, to the person it appears in. Like this person and
context a poem might be transient and ephemeral and may
disappear at any time along with them. Likely, the very sa-
me poem will re-appear in different times and contexts and
might get decoded accordingly anew, with new tools, new
language, new thoughts, as soon as its pattern is obvious
to someone.

Thus, poems are probably modular, abstract patterns of
thinking, decoupled and abstracted from but also tightly
bound to the context they appear in, to the person they
appear in. Being abstract and concrete at the same time,
their abstraction makes them applicable to different con-
texts and their concreteness connects them to the reader
and thus gives them access to the abstraction and thereby
the ability to switch context mentally and emotionally as
well. If they see it. If they allow it.

Thus, poems are for rhythm, for emphasis, for essence. Not
rhythmic patterns of syntax or language but rhythmic pat-
terns of thinking. Not a way of writing or a literary form
but a way of reading life, reading the pathos of things.
And sometimes, just a drunken thought that leaves no
trace, dying in the very same second it gets born. But even
if still born, invisible or encrypted, it just feels contenting
to know that they are surrounding us. Like it is contenting
to know that you exist. With many faces in many and peo-
ple. Somewhere. Invisibly to me like an unread poem.

### Holons

When I was 7 a friend of my parents died. I realized that he
will be gone forever. The concept of eternity suddenly became real, the concept of my own eventual death became
real. Within a second. Parents, grand parents, sister, friends, dog. We all will be gone for eternity. Eternity rushed
into my awareness, into my reality, into all the innocence.
It was violently burned into my synapses permanently. Prior to this, I was playing with toys in a bathtub. Now, I was
floating in an infinite ocean without knowing how to swim.
Alone.

I think all humans have to go through this experience and
we all get traumatized from it. This is when the little monkey brain becomes a little human brain I guess (not everybody makes this step it seems).

You are afraid of eternity like we all are. But I think eternity and time in general don’t exist in the way we think of
it. Time is just a rhythm of eternally recurring patterns.
The state of how the atoms in the universe are organized
is constantly rotating through all possible combinations.
Like what Nietzsche said about eternal recurrence. In the
current series of states the two of us exist, in past states
we didn’t and in future states we probably won’t. But if
time is eternal, it will become a perfect circle again, so we
will become again. And if the current state will never recur,
still there is no need to be scared. Because all our fears will
44die with us and all our tears will dry. And we will be part
of what is part of us. Always. I am part of you and you are
part of me.
